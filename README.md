### Scripts

Simple scripts, kept as a time-saving collection of examples.  
Each script is meant either to remind me how to perform a single taks (e.g. [points\_in_a\_cube_3d.py](matplotlib/points_in_a_cube_3d.py)) or to simplify something I do often (e.g. [aps\_article.py](python/aps_article.py)).

### Build status
Some of the (python) scripts are automatically tested at each push, via [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org).
The current build status is: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tcompa/scripts.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tcompa/scripts)
