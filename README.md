### Scripts

Simple scripts/one-liners, kept as a time-saving collection of examples.  

### Build status
Some of the (python) scripts are automatically tested at each push, via [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org)
(this is mainly to try how travis works).  
The current build status is: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tcompa/scripts.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tcompa/scripts)
