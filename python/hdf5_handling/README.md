These are basic examples of how to handle [hdf5 files](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) through the [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) python library.

[hdf5_observable.py](hdf5_observable.py), in particular, is suited to print some simple properties of the results of a simulation performed through [ALPS](http://alps.comp-phys.org/).
